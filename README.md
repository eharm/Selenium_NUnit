This repository will serve as a personal playground for Selenium (with C#) development.

I'm using NUnit as the testing tool to orchestrate the tests.

The NUnitTests folder will contain all of the tests and test orchestration code

The SeleniumLibrary folder will contain any custom Selenium modifications.
